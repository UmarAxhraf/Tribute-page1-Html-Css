    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Israr Ahmed was Islamic theologian followed particularly in South Asia
      and also among the South Asian diaspora in the Middle East, Western
      Europe, and North America. He was born on April 26, 1932 in Hisar (a
      district of East Punjab, now a part of Haryana) in India. He graduated
      from Lahore in 1954 and later received his Master's degree in Islamic
      Studies from the University of Karachi in 1965 While still a student and
      an activist of the Islami Jami`yat-e-Talaba, he became a Mudarris (or
      teacher) of the Qur'an. Even after resigning from Jama`at, he continued to
      give Quranic lectures in different cities of Pakistan, and especially
      after 1965 spent a great deal of time studying the Quran. He also worked
      with the tablighi jamaat but then left the organization due to some
      methodological differences. In 1967, Dr. Israr Ahmad wrote “Islamic
      Renaissance: The Real Task Ahead”, a tract explaining his basic belief.
      This was that a rebirth of Islam would be possible only by revitalizing
      iman (faith) among the Muslims – particularly educated Muslims – and the
      propagation of the Qur'anic teachings in contemporary idiom and at the
      highest level of scholarship is necessary to revitalize iman. This
      undertaking would remove the existing dichotomy between modern physical
      and social sciences on the one hand, and Islamic revealed knowledge on the
      other. In 1971, Dr. Israr Ahmad gave up his medical practice to devote
      himself full time to the Islamic revival. In 1972 he established or helped
      establish the Markazi Anjuman Khuddam-ul-Qur'an Lahore, Tanzeem-e-Islami
      was founded in 1975, and Tahreek-e-Khilafat Pakistan was launched in 1991.
      Dr. Israr Ahmad first appeared on Pakistan Television in 1978 in a program
      called Al-Kitab; this was followed by other programs, known as Alif Lam
      Meem, Rasool-e-Kamil, Umm-ul-Kitab and the most popular of all religious
      programs in the history of Pakistan Television, the Al-Huda, which made
      him a household name throughout the country. His television lectures
      generally focused on the revitalization of the Islamic faith through
      studies of the Quran. Ahmad also criticized modern democracy and the
      electoral system and argued that the head of an Islamic state can reject
      the majority decisions of an elected assembly. Although he did not like to
      receive it personally, Ahmad was awarded Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 1981. He has
      to his credit over 60 Urdu books on topics related to Islam and Pakistan,
      9 of which have been translated into English and other languages. In 21st
      century Ahmad came on peace TV and taught Islam to people so they could
      understand Islam. Dr. Israr Ahmed relinquished the leadership of
      Tanzeem-e-Islami in October 2002 on grounds of bad health. Supporters
      describe his vision of Islam as having been synthesized from the diverse
      sources. He has also acknowledged the "deep influence" of Shah Waliullah
      Dehlavi, the 18th century Indian Islamic leader, anti-colonial activist,
      jurist, and scholar. Ahmed followed the thinking of Maulana Hamiduddin
      Farahi and Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi, concerning what his followers
      believe is the "internal coherence of and the principles of deep
      reflection in the Qur'an". Furthermore, Ahmed followed Maulana Abul Kalam
      Azad and Maulana Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi in regards to what he believes is
      the "dynamic and revolutionary conception of Islam." In the context of
      Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of
      the genre of Maulana Mehmood Hassan Deobandi and Allama Shabbir Ahmad
      Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and
      enlightened way. Dr. Israr Ahmed believed in what he called “Islamic
      revolutionary thought,” which consists of the idea that Islam – the
      teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah – must be implemented in the
      social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life. In
      this he is said to follow Mohammad Rafiuddin and Muhammad Iqbal. The first
      attempt towards the actualization of this concept was reportedly made by
      Maulana Abul Kalam Azad through his short-lived party, the Hizbullah.
      Another attempt was made by Maulana Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi through his
      Jamaat-e-Islami party. Although the Jamaat-e-Islami has reached some
      influence, Ahmed resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the
      electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to
      "degeneration from a pure Islamic revolutionary party to a mere political
      one". Originally a member of Jamaat-e-Islami, Dr. Israr Ahmed became
      disappointed with its electoral activity, significant policy matters, and
      what he saw as the lack of effort to create an Islamic renaissance through
      the revolutionary process. He and some other individuals resigned from JI
      and in 1956 founded the nucleus of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an attempt to create
      a disciplined organization. A resolution was passed which subsequently
      became the Mission Statement of Tanzeem-e-Islami. Along with his work to
      revive the Qur'an-centered Islamic perennial philosophy and world-view
      Ahmed aimed with his party to reform the society in a practical way with
      the ultimate objective of establishing a true Islamic State, or the System
      of Khilafah. According to the Tanzeem-e-Islami website Ahmed and the party
      believe the spiritual and intellectual center of the Muslim world has
      shifted from the Arab world to the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent and
      conditions are much more congenial for the establishment of Khilafah in
      Pakistan than in other Muslim countries. According to Tanzeem-e-Islami's
      FAQ, while both Hizb ut-Tahrir and Tanzeem-e-Islami share belief in
      reviving the Caliphate as a means of implementing Islam in all spheres of
      life, Tanzeem-e-Islami does not believe in involvement in electoral
      politics, armed struggle, coup d'état to establish a caliphate, and has no
      set plan of detailed workings for the future Caliphate. Tanzeem-e-Islami
      emphasizes that iman (faith) among Muslims must be revived in "a
      significant portion of the Muslim society before there can be an Islamic
      revival. While Dr. Israr Ahmed considered himself a product of the
      teachings of comprehensive and holistic concept of the Islamic obligations
      of Abul Ala Maududi, he opposes Jamaat-e-Islami's plunge into the arena of
      power politics, which he considered to have been disastrous. Nov 19, 2007
      Dr. Israr Ahmed warned that the NATO forces are waiting on the western
      front to move into Pakistan and may deprive the country of its nuclear
      assets while on the eastern border India is ready to stage an action
      replay of 1971 events and has alerted its armed forces to intervene in to
      check threats to peace in the region. Canada's National Post newspaper
      reported in 2006 that, according to Ahmad Islam's renaissance will begin
      in Pakistan because the Arab world is living under subjugation. Only the
      Pakistan region has the potential for standing up against the nefarious
      designs of the global power-brokers and to resist the rising tides of the
      Jewish/Zionist hegemony. Asia Times reports that in September 1995 Dr.
      Israr Ahmed told the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North
      America that the process of the revival of Islam in different parts of the
      world is real. A final showdown between the Muslim world and the
      non-Muslim world, which has been captured by the Jews, would soon take
      place. The Gulf War was just a rehearsal for the coming conflict. He
      appealed to the Muslims of the world, including those in the US, to
      prepare themselves for the coming conflict. On July 27, 2007, VisionTV, a
      Canadian multi-faith religious television channel, aired an apology for
      broadcasting lectures by Mr. Ahmed. The channel had taken Ahmed off the
      air earlier that week for his derogatory comments about Jews. In reply,
      Ahmed strongly refuted the impression that he hated the Jews or he held
      anti-Semitic views, according to the National Post, but a written
      statement, issued by his personal secretary in Lahore, went on to explain
      Mr. Ahmad's belief that the Holocaust was Divine punishment and that Jews
      would one day be exterminated. The Post gave several quotes about Jews by
      Dr. Israr Ahmed including - It is apparent to any careful observer that
      the Jews have continued to suffer the floggings of Divine punishment in
      the present century – the Holocaust during the Second World War being a
      case in point. The conflict between the Jews and Muslims is going to
      result, ultimately, in the total extermination of the former, according to
      the Divine law of annihilation of the worse. Dr. Israr Ahmed died of a
      cardiac arrest at his home in Lahore on the morning of 14 April 2010
      between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m. According to his son, his health deteriorated
      at around 1:30 a.m. with pain in the back, he was a long time heart
      patient. His funeral (Namaz-e-Janazah) was held after the Asr (afternoon)
      prayers at Central Model-town Park (near Barkat Market) in the city of
      Lahore. It is reported that around twenty thousand people attended his
      funeral.
